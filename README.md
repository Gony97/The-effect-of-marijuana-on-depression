# Causal Inference Course Project: The effect of marijuana on depression

Nowadays, the use of marijuana is becoming more and more common. Although the use
of marijuana has been known to society for many years, some of it’s effects are not clear,
especially those of a person’s mental health and effects on day to day life. There are many
articles and research trying to understand these different effects, if they exist. In our project
we will try to answer the question - does smoking marijuana cause a person to experience
depression? and we will examine the different causalities that may be involved.

## The Data:
Data used in this project was gather as part of the 2019 national survey of drug use and health
(NSDUH) conducted by RTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina for the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA). This is an annual survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States
aged 12 years or older. NSDUH is the primary source of statistical information on the use of
tobacco, alcohol, prescription psychotherapeutic drugs (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,
and sedatives), and other substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine) by the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 12 years or older.

### Processing The Data:
We are interested in examining the effect of using marijuana on depression. In order to do that
we will need a group of people, our treated group, that have used marijuana for some time and we
will want to examine their mental health after a given period of time in which they did not use
marijuana. This period of time in which marijuana was not used is needed for creating a separation
between the treatment and the outcome. On the other hand, our control group will be conducted
of people who never using marijuana or hashish.

Because the definition of a person experiencing depression may vary we have decided to use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5; APA, 2013) which is based on the answer of 9 questions, further explained in the report.

Many questions were asked about the participants demographics, including education, employment,
health, and income. In order to be able and examine the effect of these different confounders on the
participants outcome we needed to minimize them in the data and so we have chosen 7 questions,
that in our understanding summarize the best the many different question asked, further explained in the report.

## Conclusions and Discussion:
In our project we tried to understand whether the use of marijuana may effect depression, cause or
reduce it. We wanted to test this causal effect by using a variety
of methods learned through out the course to evaluate the average treatment effect. As reviewed
in the results chapter in the report, we received that there is no evidence in the data of a significant effect.

It is important to state that even though we were not able to calculate an effect between the
treatment and outcome, it does not in fact state that such relation does not exist, positive or
negative effect. While working on the project, we encountered some possible weaknesses in the
data that quite possibly have some effects on our results. These challenges do match challenges
that researches in these field were encountered with.

Future work may be able to counteract these weaknesses and try to find a significant effect.
Some chances we think would have helped was creating data was was more adjusted for this
research question. For example, more specific question about a person’s marijuana use habits, and
not just general questions about the subject. But as stated many times in this work, the causes of
both marijuana use and depression are wide and vary from person to person, which causes a great
challenge trying to map all of them out in order to find a relation between the two.
